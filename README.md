## Mapster Digitizer Tool

A lot of times, you need to turn data from an image into real shapes. There are many tools out there to trace images onto maps, but most of them require downloading something like QGIS, ArcGIS, or another complicated tool. This is a simple tool we've built at Mapster that will allow you to pin an image to a map and trace it.

This was originally used a lot in Native Land when we had to digitize a lot of images of old maps into a digital format. This uses Mercator projection by default.

[Use the tool here](https://mapstertech.github.io/map-digitizer/).

### How to use

To use this, just drag an image onto the map, position it by zooming in and out, dragging the handle on the image to scale and rotate it. Then press the "Pin to Map" button. Adjust the opacity as needed.

Next, draw the shapes you want on the image. You can draw lines, polygons, or points as you need.

When you're done, press the GEOJSON button on the right to see and download your GeoJSON for your use!

### Future development

We are considering developing an "auto-digitization" tool. If you're interested, please get in touch with us about it!
